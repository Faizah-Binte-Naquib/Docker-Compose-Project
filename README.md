# User Information Form

## Project Overview
The **User Information Form** is a web application that allows users to input their name, email, and phone number through a React form. The data entered by users is displayed in a table for easy viewing. The application uses **Flask** for the backend and **MySQL** for the database to store and retrieve user information. The project is built with **JavaScript**, **Python**, **CSS**, and **HTML**, and is containerized using **Docker**.

## Features

### 1. User Information Form
- Users can enter their **Name**, **Email**, and **Phone Number** into a form built with **React**.
- The form performs basic validation to ensure that all fields are filled correctly.

### 2. Data Table
- The data entered in the form is displayed in a table after submission.
- The table shows the user's **Name**, **Email**, and **Phone Number** in a neat, organized manner.

### 3. Backend Integration
- The backend is built using **Flask** in **Python** to handle requests from the front end.
- The form data is sent to the Flask backend, which then stores the data in a **MySQL** database.

### 4. MySQL Database
- A **MySQL** database is used to store the user information.
- The database is structured to store user records, which can be retrieved and displayed in the table.

### 5. Docker Integration
- The project is containerized using **Docker** to ensure consistent development and deployment environments.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: Used for building the user interface and handling form interactions with **React**.
- **Python**: The backend logic is handled using **Flask**, a lightweight Python web framework.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the form and the data table to provide a clean, user-friendly interface.
- **HTML**: For structuring the form and the data table in the browser.
- **MySQL**: Database management system used for storing and retrieving user information.
- **Docker**: Containerization of the application to ensure consistent environments for development and deployment.
